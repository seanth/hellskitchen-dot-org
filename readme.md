# Hell's Kitchen Public Web

## Steps to update the site

1. Introduce changes to master, either by direct edits to files or approving pull requests from forks.
2. The Github Action in `.github/workflows` will deploy the site

## Admin notes

1. Several of the directories use `welcome.html` in lieu of `index.html`.  Be sure to configure your webserver to consider both as index files
