# Hell's Kitchen Public Web

## Steps to update the site

1. Introduce changes either by direct edits to files or approving pull requests from forks.
2. The site polls for updates every 30m so you should see it live after that, if not, contact grahams

## Admin notes

1. Several of the directories use `welcome.html` in lieu of `index.html`.  Be sure to configure your webserver to consider both as index files
