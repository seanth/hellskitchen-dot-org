When I first found a copy of <i>GDT</i>'s <a href="https://hellskitchen.org/gdt/PDF/Volume33/Special%20Issue--ItsMyBirthday.pdf" target="_blank">30th anniversary edition</a>, I felt like I had slipped between the seams of reality. After all, I had only heard whispers of the then-extinct <i>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</i>, and there lay a freshly printed copy of it in the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/shed" target=_blank>SHED</a>, a whopping thirty-something pages long, and being resolutely ignored by everyone around me. 
<p>
Inside its pages, I found a whole new world, one where the cruel absurdity of life was not just acknowledged but embraced, not just embraced but celebrated. With a depressing comic about rabbits breeding themselves to extinction, a tale of robot maids who malfunctioned told through reddit threads, and a centerfold map highlighting the location of Nabraska, what wasn't there to love? (The map of Nabraska, actually. It was the one joke I completely didn't understand in that issue) By reading it, I had become part of it; I was in-the-know that <i>GDT</i> was back, baby! 
<p>
I knew <i>GDT</i> had found me, somehow, and I decided, just as <i>GDT</i>  itself did, to embrace the absurdism of my position. And hoo boy, that got us far. It got <a href="https://hellskitchen.org/gdt/PDF/Volume34/" target="_blank">eight issues</a> written and published in just as many weeks, it got me to become the chief lore-creator on Nabraska, it got us a Discord server of several dozen fans, writers, printer daemons. It got us a community. 
<p>
That's the truth behind <i>GDT</i>: it has the power to create its own reality. So, I invite you to fall between the cracks dear reader, and find out what the world could be. 
<p>
Welcome to Nabraska.
