<!-- "Gracies Dinnertime Theatre" has a long history of experimenting with how to embed information in our pages. Easter eggs hidden for sharp-eyed readers, chaining multiple footnotes so they would ultimately link back into the article they started from, UUencoding an audio file and publishing it as a part of the content--we’d play with layout, typography, and neologism in our attempts to experiment with structure and meaning.

Throughout the 30th anniversary issue are ten(10) clearly marked QR codes. Each of these is 1/10th of a complete file. For those of you interested in the process, we started with an OBJ file, compressed it using zip, converted the zip to string, broke it up into 10 parts, and used each of those parts to make a QR image.

You don’t need to be particularly tech-savy to recover the 3d printable file from our pages. Atramentor helped us make a this web page to assist you, but given the fact that you are looking at the raw html you might not need hand-holding.

1.) Use your mobile to scan each of the 10 QR codes in this issue. You can recognize them because they will note the figure number out of 10 that they are. 
2.) When you scan the codes, copy the text and paste it into the text box on the web page.
3.) After entering all 10 text entries, click the “Download zip file of the OBJ model.” The web page will convert the base64 encoded text back into a zip file.
4.) Expand the zip file and you will have the OBJ of our logo ready to print. -->

<!-- Since you are here, I assume you'd be interested in the steps we used.
Everything was done via commandline, and the following includes the resonstruction tests we ran.

zip GDTLogoInTheRound.obj.zip GDTLogoInTheRound.obj
base64 -i GDTLogoInTheRound.obj.zip -o GDTLogoInTheRound.b64
split -n 10 -d GDTLogoInTheRound.b64 test
for f in test*; do qrencode -o "$f.png" -r "$f"; done
for f in test*.png; do zbarimg --raw "$f" > "b$f.txt"; done
cat btest* > reformed.b64
base64 -d -i reformed.b64 -o reconstructed.zip -->
